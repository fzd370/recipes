There are two parts to Rasmalai – the rasmalai balls and the thickened milk.

Rasmalai balls:
 To make rasmalai balls the milk is first boiled and then curdled by adding lemon juice or vinegar.
After draining the water from the curdled milk, the protein that is left is called the “chena” or “paneer”.
The chena is then mashed till it becomes smooth. Small balls are then made from that chena
and dropped in boiling sugar syrup till cooked.

The thickened milk or the ras: 
The rasmalai balls are finally dipped in thickened milk and chilled before serving. 
To make the “ras” [syrup] full fat milk is boiled till it thickens slightly. 
It is then flavored with saffron and cardamom.
